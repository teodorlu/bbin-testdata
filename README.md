# Testdata for [babashka/bbin]

Bbin is a package manager for babashka sceript.
Without Bbin, a user wanting to run your babashka script on their own computer needs to think about where to put your script, and what the script requires to run.
With Bbin, the user may install your script with one command.

If you intend to develop bbin itself, you probably want to use bbin to install sample scripts.
This repository contains such example scripts.
